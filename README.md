# kubebuilder-declarative-pattern

kubebuilder-declarative-pattern provides a set of tools for building declarative cluster operators with kubebuilder. Declarative operators provide a fast path to orchestrating Kubernetes deployments to enable domain experts to focus their component instead of re-answering questions like 'how do I get this YAML into the cluster?' or 'how do I update it?'.
